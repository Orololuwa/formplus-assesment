FRONT END ASSESSMENT FOR FORM PLUS

Functional Requirements

# There are 3 template categories; Only one category can be active at any time.

# The active category is displayed as the Header of the Template Cards. E.g If the active category is Agriculture, the header should be “Agriculture Templates”

# “All templates” is active by default. Changing the category section resets all other filters and the Search bar value.

# Template category can either be "All", "Education", "E-commerce" or "Health".

# Users should also be able to search through each template category individually using only their template names.

# There are two additional filters for the templates - Alphabetical order (based on template names) and Date Created. Users should be able to filter each template category based on either not both (reset the other filter when one is active).

# The Alphabetical Order filter can either be "Default", "Ascending" or "Descending" order

# The Date created filter can either be "Default", "Ascending" or "Descending" order

# The template links don’t need to be active
